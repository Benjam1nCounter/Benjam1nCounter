# Welcome!   

I’m @Benjam1nCounter, and I’m currently learning all things _Python_ ... (Started 3/2023)

I’m willing to collaborate on any interesting project that I could make an impact on with my current skillset. I am most interested in automation and app building, and also any creative projects that can generate money or increase profitability for something.
